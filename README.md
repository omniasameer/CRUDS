# Product Management System (CRUDs)

A simple Product Management System allowing users to add, view, update, and delete products, with search functionality to quickly find products based on specific criteria. This project demonstrates the implementation of core CRUD operations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Description

The Product Management System allows users to:
- **Add new products** with details like title, price, taxes, ads, discount, count, and category.
- **View all added products** in a tabular format, displaying relevant details for easy management.
- **Update existing products** to modify any details.
- **Delete products** individually or clear the entire product list.
- **Search** for products by title or category, enabling efficient product management.

## Features

- **Create Products**: Users can enter product details, and the system calculates the total price, storing each product along with its computed total.
  
- **Read Products**: All products are displayed in a table format, showing details such as title, price, taxes, ads, discount, total, and category, making it easy to view and manage products.

- **Update Products**: Users can select any product for editing, make changes, and see the table update immediately.

- **Delete Products**: Provides options to delete individual products or clear the entire product list, giving users full control over the inventory.

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for products by title or category, filtering the displayed products based on specified criteria.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the user interface, organizing input fields, buttons, and the product table.
- **CSS**: Provides styling with a dark theme to enhance user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Implements CRUD operations, calculates the total price, and enables the search functionality.

## Project Flow

1. **Add Product**: The user enters product details (title, price, taxes, ads, discount, count, category) and clicks "Create." The app calculates the total price and displays the product in the table.
  
2. **Edit Product**: The user selects a product to update, and its details load into the form. After editing, the user saves the changes, and the product details in the table are updated.
  
3. **Delete Product**: The user can delete a single product or clear all products, with the table reflecting the updated list.

4. **Search Products**: The user can search by title or category, filtering the displayed products to quickly locate specific items.
